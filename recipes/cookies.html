        <h2>Time To Bake !</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Strain the flour.</li>
                <li>Mix the butter and sugar to form a paste, do not beat or mix too much.</li>
                <li>Add the egg and vanilla.</li>
                <li>Add the flour little by little, along with the salt in the previous mixture, until everything is perfectly unified and does not stick to your hands.</li>
                <li>Let your mix cool in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Take your mix out of the fridge and use the cookie cutters to shape them while adding your preferred toppings.
                <li>Place parchment paper on your cookie tray and organize your cookies.</li>
                <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 350 F (176 C) until the edges are lightly golden brown and you smell freshly baked cookies; this will take approximately 15-20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Finally, let them cool off for 10 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
