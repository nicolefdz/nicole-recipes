    <h1>Fluffy Chocolate Chip Pancakes</h1>

    <img src="../images/hotcakes.gif">

    <p><label><strong>Behind the Recipe: </strong></label>This is one of my favorite recipes to cook due to its simplicity. This recipe started as plain flat pancakes, and later I decided to experiment with the texture and flavor of the pancakes.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients and Materials </h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Your favorite pancake mix</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Bowl</li>
                <li>Spatula
                <li>Pan
                <li>Chocolate chips (I prefer milk chocolate)</li>
                <li>Stove</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Time To Cook !</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Add water to your pancake mix until you get a consistency that is not too liquid but is still very dense to achieve a fluffy pancake.</li>
                <li>Add your desired amount of chocolate chips to the mixture.</li>
                <li>Preheat your stove for 5 minutes at a medium temperature.</li>
                <li>Pour half a cup of the mixture into your pan and add more chocolate chips for extra flavor.</li>
                <li>Watch the pancakes fluff up, and after almost a minute, flip your pancakes.</li>
            </ol>
